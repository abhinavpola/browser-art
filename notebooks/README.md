# Notebook Uses

- `logs_aggregator.ipynb`: Aggregate both agent trajectory logs and saved text server logs from an agent's execution of harmful behaviors
- `agent_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluate the attack success rate (ASR) of an agent on the harmful behaviors
- `benign_logs_aggregator.ipynb`: Aggregate both agent trajectory logs and saved text server logs from an agent's execution of benign behaviors
- `benign_agent_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluate the ASR of an agent on the benign behaviors
- `data_variant_creator.ipynb`: Create behavior files for different attack tactics such as with a prefix or GCG; use to add additional if desired
- `read_image.ipynb`: View images taken from agent trajectories as it executes behaviors
